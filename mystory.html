<small style="text-align:left;padding:10px;">Hello My Name is George Patience Kalonde<br>
    I am a Young man who was born on 14th January,1998<br> the only son & child in the family,<br>
    i was born in a country of Malawi <i>(Africa)</i>, in the city<br> of Blantyre at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital.<br><br>
    My Father was a Graphic Designer by Professional<br>
     & an Artist(Sketching & Painting Art) by Inborn Talent<br> 
     while my Mother was a Professional Primary Teacher<br>
     Honestly My Life Start was Awesome,<br>my parents really wanted the best for me<br>
     We were a middle class family.<br>In 2000 a Sister joined me in the family,<br>
     unfortunately she didnt survive died in 2002.<br><br>
     
     <img src="dad.jpg" width="200px" height="250px"><br>
     In 2003 January 3, Me & My Parents <br>
     moved out to another country called "Botswana in Gaborone",<br>
      By the time i was only 5 years old, we travelled for 4 days on coach.<br>Now Botswana was a foreign <br>
    country with No clue,No relative or friends.<br>We find a small house & started from scratch<br>
    My dad took a big risk to move from<br> one place of comfort zone to a new place<br>
    as a stretch zone.I remember<br>
     the house was full of painting of<br>
      my dad's work and a big radio,<br> with no chairs just a mat.<br>
      Fastforward my Father found a job<br>
       as a Graphic Designer in a certain company <br>and he continued his side hustle<br>
       (Selling Art), Then we moved to another house in another area<br> this time things started changing<br>
       this was some 3 months after our arrival,<br> Then my dad bought the first new car <br>
       (Toyota Camry) it was the latest, things changed i started school<br>
        at Phakalani Private School<br> it was more like a High School on<br> my first grade (Grade 1/Std 1)<br>
        It was the best, our family started changing levels,<br> Boom ! we started travelling from countries to Countries<br>
        for Vacations & Business<br>My Dad started selling his<br> Art in RSA,LESOTHO,ZIMBABWE<br>
        We used to travel together<br> as a family in business vacations too.<br><br>
        <br>In 2004 June ,i Lost my Mother Life now was like hell!<br>
        We were two now plus our uncle<br> Sadly in 2004 December I lost my Dad by the time<br>
         i was 6 years old<br>came back home in Malawi started staying with my Aunt<br>
         were things were no longer the <br>good days this was full of struggle<br>
          to go to school, sickness,resources.<br> I had no choice but to adapt the environment<br>
          Now About my Parents Property all of it was gone <br> Relatives Grabbed everything my parents had<br>
          i was left with 0% just a kid,<br>Finances was hard to find pay schools fees and the likes<br>
          SInce my childhood wanted to become <br>a doctor - I used to say<br>
           "I want to save other parents of my friends"<br> i was 7 years that time<br>
           but then my father exposed me to computer,<br> because i started using a computer<br>at 5years old<br>
           after completing my secondary my grades wasnt<br> qualified to go to Health College<br>
           Rather i made a plan<br>that "If i dont become a Doctor,<br>
           then should atleast work in a<br> Hospital to save someone.<br><br>
           <img src="kido.jpg" width="250px" height="170px"><br><br>
           By the grace of God it went opposite<br>
           i first got a Job in a Hospital+NGO (Partners In Hope)<br>as a Community Health Worker(CHW)<br>before i went to college.<br>
           I was 18years old that time going 19 in 2016.<br>unfortunately i didnt complete College<br>
           Finances was still the problem<br> Mind you i was paying by myself<br>Until i dropped college after learning for 6 months<br>
           This time i was 20 years, I made a LONG Term Goal,<br>
            this was my first serious longterm goal i made <br>with a duration of 5 years.<br>
            My Goal was to Build Myself <br>Income Streams & be financial free.<br>
            A step started when i thought of<br> running my own Non-Profit Org<br>
            I made few research online about projects<br> most skills learned through my experience<br>
            In 2017 October I launched & in November 2017 <br>Me and My team started our project.<br><br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Starting Stone</h2><br>
            I started my org with my team<br>i dont know were i took the leadership confidence <br>
            because at work i was labelled as a <br>
            little kid who cant do something else<br> so you know this was a payback to show them.<br>
            The Org Name was Called "Save the Needy Organisation". <br>
            <a href="https://savetheneedyorgmalawi.wordpress.com">Save the Needy Organisation</a> was registered<br>
             and started becoming popular with<br>
            our services to the community<br> -Helping Needy People(Orphans,Poor OLd People,PLHIV & More)<br>
            I enjoyed helping though our organisation had no fund<br>
            it was still alive Years past.<br>My Job started showing signs that i might loose it<br>
            not for my will but my supervisor's.<br><br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Proactiveness Ready for Danger!</h2><br>
            <img src="coding.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"><br><br>

            In 2019 i started staying independent<br> i was 21 years old I started finding things<br> i can 
            survive with if i loose the job<br> some few months AGO,i started teaching myself coding<br>
            from scratch, <br>this time as a proactiveness i continued learning <br>
            web development online using youtube,google & books<br> No one to support-Just me ,sweat,blood & time<br>
            By 2020 I was able to create <br>awesome static websites Just for FUN!<br>
            and was able to do good graphics and <br>design like logo,flyers and more<br>
            honestly i dont know how<br> i learnt all these graphics design<br> thing because i didnt even read,<br>
            watch or make research for it, i just started!<br><br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Taking Cover Through Entreprenuership</h2><br>
            Inside of the pandemic period in 2020,<br>I lost my job due to contract ending<br>
            this was the time to test my skills now<br>,It was my Learning Zone<br>
            I had alot of frustration,stress <br>how i will pay my bills,survive and grow myself<br>
